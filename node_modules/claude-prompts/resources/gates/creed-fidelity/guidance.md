# Materials Creed Fidelity

The Materials Creed lives at the top of `docs/DESIGN_BIBLE.md` in the CloudySky repo
(`~/Applications/cloudySky`). It is eight numbered lines; each is a test a screenshot can
pass or fail. "Does it match the vibe" is unfalsifiable — naming the line you are closest
to BREAKING is the check that has teeth.

## Required statement (three fields, cite lines by number)

```
creed: serves line <n> (<short quote>) · risks line <m> (<short quote>) · check: <observable — tools/cdp probe, screenshot judgment, or measured delta>
```

One statement per design direction, plan tier, or calibration verdict — not per file.

## Escape hatch

If the work touches no CloudySky visual/aesthetic surface (pure infra, tests, docs,
tooling), state exactly: `creed: n/a — no visual surface` and pass. Do not force a
creed mapping onto non-visual work.

## Failure modes this gate catches

- **Glow relapse** — an additive term shaped by distance-to-edge (risks line 2: depth
  lives IN the medium, never ON the edge). Check: interior-vs-edge-band luma delta.
- **Painted bubble** — a card treatment that paints highlights instead of bending the
  backdrop (risks line 5). Check: lensing visible in an ab-diff against the field.
- **Luma-spending hue** — iridescence/film that brightens instead of rotating hue
  (risks line 6). Check: readability.mjs Lc delta ±2.
- **Scattered shore** — boundary effects sprinkled uniformly instead of composed
  (risks line 4). Check: owner-eye screenshot vs the raked-garden reading.
- **Wet art** — refraction/film reaching album art, buttons, or text (risks line 7).
  Check: reserved-dry surfaces crisp in golden --check.

## Verdict

PASS only when the statement is present, cites line numbers, and names an observable
check (or uses the n/a escape verbatim). FAIL with the missing field named.
